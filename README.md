# Co-op Ambassador Program

## Introduction

This repository hosts a set of materials to implement the Co-op Ambassador program at a company for co-op hiring. The program is designed to remove the burden of hiring from upper management and distribute that load to software developers instead. It will also grow the soft skills of your software developers, introducing them to low-stakes interviewing.

### What are Co-op Ambassadors?
The Co-op Ambassadors are a set of developers across departments at the company that are passionate about bringing in the next wave of new talent. When possible they are often recent hires or past co-ops themselves, with a close connection to the post-secondary experience.

The Ambassadors are responsible for the recruiting process of new co-op hires. Their duties include reviewing resumes, conducting 1-on-1 interviews, and recommending which candidates should be hired. They also help out with team placement and orientation of the new hires.

It's a good opportunity to gain interviewing skills, learn about the hiring process, explore different parts of the company that you might not normally be involved in, and help shape the future of our teams.

## The Ambassador Program

### Who can be an Ambassador?
Any developers at the company with a passion or desire to learn about the hiring process is eligible to become a Co-op Ambassador. There is a general preference for recent hires or past co-op hires that have returned full time, as they tend to have a fresher context of "what makes the company an interesting place to work at?", but this is not strictly required. We encourage anyone with the passion to join the Ambassador team.

### What if I have no Interview Experience?
The position requires conducting 1-on-1 interviews with candidates, but there is no prior interview experience required to become an Ambassador. We have comprehensive screening and interview guides that provide ambassadors all the resources you will need to succeed. There is also a training session hosted where the guides are covered live and in-depth for proper knowledge transfer. In addition before each round of interviews, ambassadors have the opportunity to shadow a previous ambassador during an interview.

### What is the Ambassador team structure?

The team structure will vary depending on the company size and number of co-ops hired each term. For a standard company hiring approximately 15 co-ops each term, the suggested structure is:

* 1 Program Leader
* 1 Recruiter from Human Resources
* 3 Junior Ambassadors (First-term)
* 3 Senior Ambassadors (1+ terms of experience)

This team structure ensures you constantly have new talent flowing through the program, while maintaining a level of seniority for mentorship. It is recommended to rotate out ambassadors after 2-3 terms in the program. This ensures that we are providing other developers the ability to participate and not pull resources away from development teams for multiple terms in a row.

### What are the benefits of the program?

Running the co-op ambassador program at your company provides multiple benefits:

* It removes the burden of interviewing co-op positions from managers so they can dedicate their time to more important activities
* Grow the soft-skills of developers, providing low-risk interview experience. This can translate into additional resources for interviewing full-time positions if they are successful
* Ensure a pipeline of high-quality co-op hires into your company. This leads to the possibility of converting co-op positions into full time hires when they graduate school.
