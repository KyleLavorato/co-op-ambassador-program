# Screening Primer

## What is Resume Screening?

Screening is the process of inspecting resumes and selecting the best candidates for interviews. For co-op screening, we get a LOT of resumes. We currently partner with three different schools and for each school, we may get 100+ resumes for each co-op term. On average, we can expect to interview ~3-4 people for each opening that we have for the upcoming term. The screening process is used to narrow down the large number of applications to just those we deem qualified for an interview.

## Two-Pass Approach to Screening

There are multiple approaches to screening resumes, but the method that we suggest is the two-pass method described below.

### Pass One

This pass applies a several requirements to remove the least-eligible candidates without going into too much detail into the resume. Each resume **must meet** the following criteria to move onto the next pass:

* GPA must meet the minimum GPA threshold for their school as noted in the table below. See note for when the lower threshold is acceptable.
* The student is at a minimum in Year 2 of their education
* Completion of at least one previous work term and cannot have any `Good` or `Satisfactory` score (when a score is provided)
* There is no poor resume structure (resume has bad formatting, spelling mistakes, etc.)

During this pass, be careful not to eliminate candidates that are still in the early years of their degree (first or second year) or those that have no prior co-op terms on their record. Since the company is willing to teach and train co-ops, we are willing to accept these candidates if they do well in the interview process and show passion. However, if we have a large number of standout candidates that do have related experience, we may need to drop the less experienced candidates since we do not have time to interview everyone.

| **School (A+ Grade)** | **GPA Required (B-)** | **Minimum GPA Permitted\* (C+)** | **Where to Find** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| University A (10 GPA scale) | 6 | 5 | Included in the grading transcript |
| University B (12 GPA scale) | 7 | 6 | Included in the grading transcript |
| University C (100 scale) | 72 | 68 | Only calculated per term in the transcript |

\*This value is only acceptable if the student has consistent A level grades in their computing classes

### Pass Two

At this point the number of resumes has been reduced to a reasonable number, so we can now look at each resume in more depth and determine which candidates seem the most promising for an interview. There is no concrete rating system or easy way to know whether a resume represents a great candidate. All we can do is remain impartial and use our best judgement based on the content that is presented to us. It is recommended to compare resumes to each other to determine which ones stand out.

A helpful method is after you review each candidate start a list of names of candidates that you think might be interview worthy. After each resume, slot the name in the list relative to the other resumes that you screened. Then at the end you can set a cutoff point on your list to determine which top of the list candidates should be interviewed.

#### Screening Guidelines

When screening, it is suggested to use the following guidelines to look for both good and bad resume elements to help with your ranking. Remember that the content of the resume is not the only thing under review. A poorly written, unorganized, or irrelevant resume does not normally translate to a strong candidate.

**Positive Points**

* Do they have relevant past work experience?
* Is there any meaningful project work (personal or school)?

    * If they list a GitHub account you should briefly look at it to check for project quality (ie. is there a README, etc)
    * Any project experience demonstrating team work

* Does the resume demonstrate a passion for programming and a desire to learn?
* Do they have good grades (A grade average)? Are the good grades from relevant classes?
* Are they in 3rd or 4th year? This indicates more experience.
* Did they receive good feedback from past employers? The applications through schools may have a page that lists the feedback from the past co-op employers.
* Do they have any extracurricular involvements like student clubs, volunteering experiences, etc? This indicates that they are not only good programmers but also have gone beyond what others students have done.
* Do they list accomplishments that are noteworthy?

    * An accomplishment should be something above a standard job duty (Eg. Managing something is not an accomplishment)
    * Look for quantifiers such as "Top 10%", "Number 1", or specific awards


**Negative Points**

* Skills and past experience is very vague
* Education is not directly in a programming-related field (Eg. Math major)

    * This does not apply if they have programming experience or side projects

* Resume content is hard to understand (Poorly written)
* Mistakes in resume (Look in closer detail, as the obvious ones were discarded in pass one)
* Large quantity of irrelevant material on resume (Eg. Very out-of-date content)
* Poor/satisfactory feedback from past co-op employers

### Final Selection

There is no hard requirement for how many candidates to recommend for interviews from each screening session. However, we need to balance it around the target number of co-ops to be hired for each term. We normally want to interview ~1.5-2x the number of candidates we are hiring. For example, if we want 15 co-ops for the term, we would like to have 30-40 interviews. We normally have 6 ambassadors, meaning each one should target 3-6 candidates to recommend for an interview in total for round one (across all three schools). It is better to schedule fewer interviews than interview a large number of potentially bad candidates. Inversely, it is also better to interview additional candidates if they all look like they may be superstars.

Once the candidates to interview have been selected, you need to add them to the _Candidate Selection_ Excel sheet for the current term (the excel sheets are located in the shared team drive), filling out the **Name**, **School**, **Student Email**, **Year of Study**, **Grad Date**, and **Total GPA** (See where to find column in the table from Pass One. Note that some schools may only provide GPA per term and will need to be calculated manually) columns. Once all candidates have been selected, interviews will be scheduled with the co-op ambassadors by HR.
