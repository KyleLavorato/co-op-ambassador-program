# Interview Primer

<div style="background-color: #deebff; border-left: 4px solid #0747a6; padding: 12px; margin: 16px 0; color: #000000;">
ℹ️ This primer is written to provide a base script for all co-op interviews. This acts to invoke fairness across all interviewers as there will be an element of standardization in questions and scoring.
</div>

As a co-op ambassador, you will be interviewing multiple candidates to help select the next generation of talent for the company. In order to accomplish that goal successfully, you must be able to conduct interviews in a consistent way that you get a good sense of the candidate's skills, while also showing them why they would want to work at the company. This primer has been put together as a one-stop shop for all interview needs. It is a tailored guide for co-op hiring, designed for people who are brand new to interviewing.

<div style="background-color: #fffae6; border-left: 4px solid #ff991f; padding: 12px; margin: 16px 0; color: #000000;">
⚠️ When preparing and interviewing, it is important to remember that all interviews will not be perfect. Expect <u>things may go wrong</u>. There is a lot of information to remember and moving parts. Things can happen like running out of time, candidates going on a tangent, or missing a section. Part of being a co-op ambassador is building interview skills so it is okay for mistakes to happen. When things go awry, do your best to get it back on track and adjust scores where possible to still give the candidate a fair chance. We do not expect all interviews to be perfect!
</div>

## Before the Interview

Before you start each interview, there is some preparation required (<10 mins). Start by downloading a copy of the candidate's resume and read through it, as it will likely not be a candidate that you screened. Highlight a section or two that interests you as a potential conversation point during the interview. You may have candidates that do not open up much during the interview, and being able to ask them about content directly on their resume will give you information about them. It also keeps the interview process more personal.

You <u>must</u> also download a copy of the **Candidate Evaluation Form** for each candidate. This will be the guideline for scoring the candidate (more information on that later) and provides an area for you to save all the questions you plan on asking during the interview. This will allow you to be prepared for the interview by having questions pre-selected (based on the candidate's resume) and space to add answers. (You can still change questions on the fly if really required, but try to stick to your template to make it easier)

Save a copy of this evaluation form named for each candidate you interview. This will allow you to revisit past interviews later on to adjust scores if necessary. You should also jot down some notes while the candidate is speaking in the description columns so you have a reference to go back to later. These forms do not need to be submitted, they are just saved for your own reference and can be deleted after all interviews are complete.

### How to Sell the Company

An important concept to keep in mind when conducting co-op interviews is that it is not just the co-op being interviewed. They are also similarly evaluating the company as a whole to determine if it is somewhere they would want to work. Co-op's will have multiple places they are interviewing, so if we want them to accept our offer, we need to "sell" the company to them during the interview. This is a combined effort of educating them on what opportunities the company can provide them, as well as what sets the company apart from other employers.

<div style="background-color: #e3fcef; border-left: 4px solid #00875a; padding: 12px; margin: 16px 0; color: #000000;">
✅ <strong>Selling to Students</strong>

To get students interested in the company, you need to think from the position of a student, what do they want in a co-op employer? A good pitch should also feel genuine so feel free to go off script and talk about your own experiences with co-ops, especially if related to these key points. Some key points are listed below:

1. **The company has the potential for a full time employment offer after graduation**
    * Students will be attracted to a position where they feel they have a good chance of a future career. Students are often stressed about finding a job after graduation and this opportunity may attract them here. (Be careful how you phrase this as no co-op is guaranteed to receive this offer)

2. **The co-op program is designed to teach students a wide array of skills. Co-ops will be given opportunities to work on multiple areas within their team's scope and may have more formal training opportunities as well.**
    * The other main goal of students is to <u>learn</u> during their co-op so they are attracted to companies that are willing to teach them the skills they want. We offer instructor led training opportunities to co-ops (e.g., cloud platforms, certifications).

3. **The company treats co-ops as full members of the team, they get to do the same tasks as everyone else and feel a sense of responsibility**
    * Co-ops may have had an experience at a previous placement where they were treated as inferior or given "side tasks". This is not the case at our company.

4. **Talk about your own experiences as a co-op or with co-ops that were a part of your team**
    * This is your chance to give genuine examples of how great the co-op program is

</div>

#### What Sets us Apart

There are multiple benefits to choosing our company over other employers. The biggest thing that sets us apart is the feeling of caring that coworkers and the management have for all employees. Co-ops are treated like full members of the team from day one. There is no feeling of being inferior or not being given "real tasks" just because you aren't a full time employee. There are frequent 1:1 check ins with your manager, as well as an open door to talk to any of the managers in the office any time there are issues, or ideas to discuss. Not only is everyone open to hearing ideas, but they also care about your happiness in your current role.

There are also many opportunities for learning and freedom. There are both training certifications, and classes, that are available for employees to request. These are funded by the company and for the growth of employee's skillsets. In addition, employees have some freedom in the tasks that they work on. If there is ever something someone hates, they will not be forced into doing it, but they must stay on target for the current goals.

The company also hosts occasional internal hack days. When the opportunity arises, the hack days are chances for employees to take a day or two to create any software based project they can think of (non-work related) and compete with other employees for prizes. We also have regular fun office events and other events dedicated just for the co-ops to make coming to work a bit more fun.

#### Company Culture

If you were to ask any employee to describe the culture of the company, most would state that it is nothing short of amazing. Described here are some key points that potential candidates would be most keen to hear about. There are two main types of company culture to talk about with the current WFH situation, and both are equally important to discuss.

* Co-workers are always very friendly, often times dropping by your cubicle to have a brief chat or to go on coffee runs together.
* A large lunchroom with seating for people to have lunch together and chat instead of eating at their cubicle and doing work at the same time.
* The lunchroom hosts ping-pong, foosball tables, Nintendo Switch, and a golf simulator for employees to relax.
* A great team culture, with many teams going out for lunches together.
* On Thursdays there is a Happy Hour where employees would stop working an hour early and grab some snacks and a drink from our beer tap with their co-workers to get an early start to the weekend.

## Interview Structure

The standard co-op interview is structured fairly simply to be able to get all required information from the candidate, without getting too in depth. Since these are interviews with students, we do not expect them to have the same level of skill as a full time hire. The basic interview is 30 minutes long and should roughly follow the below breakdown:

1. **~3 min:** Introduction of candidate and yourself
2. **~13 min:** Standard interview questions (Company Core Values)
3. **~5 min**: Technical questions (skills / experience)
4. **~4 min**: Sell the Company
5. **~5 min**: Wrap up and opportunity for candidate to ask questions

While conducting your interviews, 30 minutes may seem like a long time, but once you get started, it will go by quickly. Therefore it is important to watch the time to ensure you are able to fit in each of the sections in the above breakdown. If running behind, it is best to cut the standard questions short, as you must ensure to provide time for wrap up to allow the candidate to ask questions. We want candidates to walk away from this interview with a positive experience.

<div style="background-color: #deebff; border-left: 4px solid #0747a6; padding: 12px; margin: 16px 0; color: #000000;">
ℹ️ During some interviews, you may conclude that the candidate is not hiring potential partway through the interview. In these cases, we still want to give the candidate the full interview experience as to not hurt the company's reputation
</div>

## Interview Script

This section covers each of the core parts of the interview structure and what to discuss during each.

<div style="background-color: #ffebe6; border-left: 4px solid #de350b; padding: 12px; margin: 16px 0; color: #000000;">

❌ <strong>Questions / Topics to Avoid</strong>

As an interviewer, there are certain topics and questions that cannot be legally asked, or should be generally avoided as they are considered inappropriate. Make sure you are familiar with this list and refer back to if if asking questions that go off script.

* We cannot promise a certain position or team to any candidates. We will do our best to cater to preference, but an unfulfilled promise may break the terms of co-op agreements with schools.
* Language should be kept to a professional standard; Avoid using slang and colorful language.
* Topics related to protected characteristics **cannot** be mentioned or considered in hiring decisions. Protected characteristics under Canadian law include:
  * Race, color, ethnicity, national or ethnic origin
  * Religion or creed
  * Sex (including pregnancy and gender identity)
  * Sexual orientation
  * Age
  * Disability (physical or mental)
  * Marital or family status
  * Genetic characteristics
  * Pardoned criminal convictions (in some provinces)
* Salary should only be discussed if the candidate directly asks. The official answer to this question is in the FAQ section.
* Any HR related questions (eg. vacation policy) must be directed to HR if they are sent an offer

</div>

### Introduction

The purpose of the introduction is to break the ice and get some initial information from the candidate. You should start by introducing yourself and then asking some introductory questions (make sure to note the answers):

"Hello, I am _______________, from [Company Name], how are you doing today?" ... "Before we get started today I would like to cover a few basic questions with you. Please bear with me as I will be taking some notes as we have our conversation." ...

**Q:** Please tell me a little bit about yourself and why you are interested in [Company Name]?

If you don't get all the information from that initial question, follow up with the questions below. (This is all required for the ranking spreadsheet)

**Q**: What year of studies are you currently in?
**Q**: When do you expect to graduate?

### Interview Questions

Provided below are interview questions that are tailored towards co-op interviews. On average you should select a quantity of questions specified by each category to ask a candidate (time permitting). When asking these questions, it is important to objectively capture what the candidate has said as close to verbatim as possible. You want to capture what the candidate said, not how you interpret it, as it has the potential to inject bias.

When asking questions, keep in mind the **STAR** principle:

* **S**ituation - do you understand the situation that the candidate is describing?
* **T**ask - is it clear what the candidates task was in that situation?
* **A**ction - has the candidate clearly explained what action they took?
* **R**esult - is there a result that is tied to the action

<details>
<summary>❓ Information Questions (Pick up to 4)</summary>

These questions are designed to get some initial information from the candidate. They may assist with some of the behavioural section of the scoring sheet directly or indirectly, it all depends on the information the candidate provides.

| Question |
|----------|
| **Q**: What is your strongest programming language? |
| **Q**: What area of software is most interesting to you? |
| **Q**: What do you see as your ideal career path when you graduate? |
| **Q**: What excites you most about [Company Name]? |
| **Q**: What are you looking to get out of a co-op experience? |
| **Q**: What do you do when you have trouble solving a problem? |
| **Q**: How do you set yourself up for success? |

The best question in this section is asking what excites the candidate the most about potentially working at the company. This question helps assess the candidate's familiarity with the company. If a candidate provides a generic answer or is unfamiliar with our company, use this as an opportunity to briefly educate them about the company rather than viewing it negatively. Some candidates may have limited access to research resources, or nerves may affect their response. At a minimum, ensure candidates leave the interview understanding what the company does.

> [Insert company description here - e.g., "[Company Name] is a technology company specializing in [industry/domain]. We develop products including [product examples]. Our office has a wide range of development opportunities, such as back-end, front-end, [languages], cloud development, and more!"]

</details>

<details>
<summary>❓ Behavioural Questions (Pick up to 4)</summary>

These questions are designed to prompt the candidate to talk about their past experiences in more depth. The **what** of these questions is important, but the **why** is the most critical piece. This will indicate to us how the candidate is able to handle different scenarios and what their reasoning is. This section will be the bulk of the interview time and will be the information used for the behavioural and experience section of the scoring sheet.

| Question |
|----------|
| **Q**: Tell me about your favourite project you worked on so far. Why was it your favourite? This can be from a school project or work term. |
| **Q**: Describe a skill you learned from a previous work term that you found the most rewarding or interesting. |
| **Q**: What was the most challenging project or job you have worked on? What did you do to overcome the challenge? |
| **Q**: What class do you think taught you the most? What did you learn? |
| **Q**: Tell me about a time that you failed or did not meet a goal. What did you do? |
| **Q**: I see you completed/participated in ______ on your resume. What is one lesson you learned during it? |
| **Q**: Tell me about a time you worked on a team and things didn't go so well. What did you do? |
| **Q**: Describe a time where you took charge or helped those around you to complete a task. |
| **Q**: Give me an example of a time when you had to go above and beyond to get a job done. |

</details>

<details>
<summary>❓ Skill Questions (Pick 2)</summary>

The skill questions are designed to get a quick indication if the candidate knows basic programming concepts. They are tailored to the concepts that 2nd - 4th year students should be learning in university, so they all should be able to answer them. The questions are all have an estimated difficulty level based on which year the candidate is in to avoid asking anything they would not have learned yet.

---

#### Question #1 (Difficulty: Year 2)

**Q:** Is it better to ship software frequently with bugs, or less often but with less bugs? Why?

**A:** We prefer fast and frequent but a lot of people actually reply with slow, expecting quality to be higher. The real meat of this answer is the why… have the student explain their rationale for their choice and see if you can get them to describe a situation where they confronted this.

---

#### Question #2 (Difficulty: Year 2)

**Q:** Explain two benefits of moving software to the cloud. What is a downside of cloud software?

**A:** The benefits and downside can be anything that you deem to be acceptable and should have some explanation behind them. Below are some examples of acceptable answers:

**Benefits**
* Increased scalability to your customers
* Increased availability (online time) of your software
* Ease of deploying software updates - Everyone is always on the latest version
* Removes the need to purchase hardware to host your software

**Downsides**
* Cloud services can be much more expensive then traditional hosting
* Setting up infrastructure can be complex and time consuming

---

#### Question #3 (Difficulty: Year 3)

**Q:** What is a thread in the context of software development? What is the benefit of having threads?

**A:** A thread is an execution context or unit of execution for a program, containing all the information the CPU needs to run a set of instructions. The benefit of threads is we can have multiple running at the same time with modern processors. This allows multiple parts of a program to execute simultaneously.

The answer should be some form of the description above.

---

#### Question #4 (Difficulty: Year 3)

**Q:** Explain three reasons why we want to use source control software in software development?

**A:** Accept any answers that seem reasonable, some examples are shown below:

* Backup of source code in a secure location
* Ability to rollback to a previous stable version of code
* Allow code to be reviewed before it is released to production
* Allow code to be automatically be tested before it is released to production
* Allows multiple developers to work on the same code base simultaneously

---

#### Question #5 (Difficulty: Year 2)

**Q:** List <u>three</u> reasons why we test software before we release it and <u>two</u> different ways we can test software.

**A:** This question is pretty open ended, make sure their answers make sense. Some example responses are below:

**Reasons**
* Ensure no bugs/working as intended
* Check for user experience
* Look for performance issues
* Ensure user requirements were met

**Methods**
* Unit testing
* Manual testing
* Regression testing
* Integration testing
* Exploratory testing

---

#### Question #6 (Difficulty: Year 3)

**Q:** What is a mutex and why would we want to use one? Why do we need to be careful when using them?

**A:** A mutex allows us to ensure only one thread is able to access data in a critical section at one time, preventing race conditions. We must be careful when using them to ensure that we do not introduce deadlock into the program.

</details>

<details>
<summary>❓ Technical Questions (Pick 1-2)</summary>

The technical questions are a quick validation of the candidate's programming skills. There is not time in the short 30 minute interviews to have the candidate write any code, so these questions are designed to determine if they can understand code. Each question is written in pseudocode to be language agnostic so all candidates can understand them.

It is recommended to ask the candidate either questions 1 and 2, or only question 3 to compose the entire score for this section on the scoring sheet. Which questions to select depends on the candidate's current year of schooling. If they are a second year, use question 1/2. If they are a third year, either option can be selected. If they are a fourth year, use question 3.

---

#### Question #1 (Easy)

**Q:** Please describe the output from this pseudocode?

```
LOOP i = 1 to 10
    IF i is divisible by 2 AND i is divisible by 5 THEN
        PRINT "FizzBuzz"
    ELSE IF i is divisible by 2 THEN
        PRINT "Fizz"
    ELSE IF i is divisible by 5 THEN
        PRINT "Buzz"
    ELSE
        PRINT i
END LOOP
```

**Answer:**

1, Fizz, 3, Fizz, Buzz, Fizz, 7, Fizz, 9, FizzBuzz

**For your Knowledge:**

This program <u>prints numbers</u> from 1 to 10.
* For multiples of 2, you need to print "Fizz"
* For multiples of 5, you need to print "Buzz"
* For the multiples of both 2 and 5, you need to print "FizzBuzz"

---

#### Question #2 (Medium)

**Q:** Please determine the output of this code and its complexity. How could the code be refactored to reduce complexity? The order of the elements in the array *does not matter* after refactoring. (Can answer verbally or write code)

```
INT[] arr = [2, 4, 6, 2, 5, 8, 4, 4]
INT[] arrNew
FOR (i = 0; i < len(arr); i++)
    BOOL cond = false
    FOR (j = i + 1; j < len(arr); j++)
        IF arr[i] == arr[j]
            cond = true
    IF !cond
        arrNew.append(arr[i])
print(arrNew)
```

**Answer:**

The code will remove duplicated numbers in the array; Saving the final instance of each number.

Output: **<6, 2, 5, 8, 4>**
Complexity: **O(n^2)**

Below is a code answer to refactor the code to a complexity of **O(n*log(n))**. By sorting the array first, we can simply compare adjacent entries to search for duplicates.

```
INT[] arr = [2, 4, 6, 2, 5, 8, 4, 4]
INT[] arrNew
arr.Sort()
FOR (i = 0; i < len(arr) - 1; i++)
    IF arr[i] != arr[i+1]
        arrNew.append(arr[i])
arrNew.append(arr[len(arr)-1])
print(arrNew)
```

---

#### Question #3 (Hard)

**Q:** The code below represents a simple multi-threaded transfer process defined through a resource class. What is the expected output of running this code? If there are any issues with the class explain what the problem is and how it can be fixed, and what the desired output is.

```
CLASS Resource(i)::
    PUBLIC value = i

    remove(quantity)::
        self.value -= quantity

    add(quantity)::
        self.value += quantity

    transfer(from, to, quantity)::
        lock(from)
        from.remove(quantity)
        lock(to)
        to.add(quantity)
        unlock(from)
        unlock(to)

main::
    Resource data1 = new Resource(5)
    Resource data2 = new Resource(10)
    Thread t1 = new Thread()
    Thread t2 = new Thread()
    t1.start(Resource.transfer(data1, data2, 2)
    t2.start(Resource.transfer(data2, data1, 10)
    t1.Wait()
    t2.Wait()
    print(data1.value, data2.value)
```

**Answer:**

The expected output is that the code will enter deadlock and sit waiting. The issue with the code is that it will enter deadlock.

This can be fixed in a multitude of ways, any answer that will solve the problem is acceptable. The simplest and desired answer is simply unlock the from mutex after the call to remove (unlock the mutex as soon as we are done using it instead of waiting until the end).

The desired output is: [13, 2]

</details>

### Wrap Up

During wrap up you should thank the candidate for taking the time to speak with you. Then give the candidate the floor so they have the opportunity to ask you any questions that they may have. Most candidates will come to the interview with 1-2 questions they plan to ask, and then may think of more during the interview.

<div style="background-color: #e3fcef; border-left: 4px solid #00875a; padding: 12px; margin: 16px 0; color: #000000;">

✅ An <u>optional</u> final question to ask could be:

* **"What question were you hoping I'd ask you today but I didn't?"**
* Follow up with exploratory questions. For example, if they say "I was expecting you to ask me how I'd architecture the thing you're building", the immediate follow-up should be "So how would you architect this thing we're building?"

</div>

The below FAQ section contains common questions we have received in the past and the official answers to them. If a candidate asks you a question and you do not know the answer **do not make up an answer**. Instead let them truthfully know that you do not know the answer, but can find out and will follow-up with them via email. (Remember to add the question and answer to the FAQ afterwards).

#### Candidate Team Assignment

When it comes to matching the hired co-ops to a team for their term, this is all handled by the managers. Before the start of each term, the managers will assign the co-ops to each team based on the current business needs. They will make the individual selections based on the candidate's skill set, viewing the resume, summarized skills, and any potential recommendation that the interviewer has noted in the excel sheet. <u>For a list of the current projects and opportunities that the company has available, see the FAQ section.</u>

As part of the interview process you should inquire with the candidate about which development area they are interested in. This can be something broad like Backend or Cloud, or just a technology they want to learn. Once the interview is complete, the interviewer must fill in the <u>Team Preference</u> box for what the candidate is interested in and the <u>Team Recommendation</u> box for where **you think** the candidate is the best fit. Take into consideration their skills, experience, and preference as a final factor.

<div style="background-color: #fffae6; border-left: 4px solid #ff991f; padding: 12px; margin: 16px 0; color: #000000;">
⚠️ We cannot promise a candidate any position during the interview process. We will note their preference but final allocation is based on their skills and business needs

## Post Interview

Once the interview has completed you should summarize your notes **right** **away**. You will be interviewing many co-ops and you will find they will quickly being to blur together. Therefore take ~10 minutes to review all your notes and collect final thoughts on the candidate. This should conclude with entering a rating for the candidate in the summary table that all ambassadors are using. The summary tables are located in the shared team drive.

#### What we are Looking for

When determining how to rate a candidate, it is important to keep in mind the qualities that we are looking for in an employee. Since co-ops will have limited skills, it is important for them to possess these desired qualities for them to be successful at the company.

<div style="background-color: #e3fcef; border-left: 4px solid #00875a; padding: 12px; margin: 16px 0; color: #000000;">

✅ <strong>Qualities we are Looking for</strong>

* Do they have the willingness to learn?
* Are they engaged during the interview process? They should show some interest in the company itself.
* Are they properly prepared for the interview? Do they know anything about us? Are they professional in their dress, environment, and demeanor?
* Have they worked on any personal projects? This shows a passion for programming.
* Does their resume show they excel in what they do, or does it show the bare minimum of what is required by their school?
* Do you feel like this individual can provide value to any team they are placed on?

</div>

<div style="background-color: #ffebe6; border-left: 4px solid #de350b; padding: 12px; margin: 16px 0; color: #000000;">

❌ <strong>What to Avoid</strong>

An important aspect of rating candidates is eliminating as much bias as possible. Therefore when answering the above questions and evaluating the candidate's answers, try to look at things objectively from outside your perspective. One question that should not factor into your rating is *"Would you like to work with this candidate?"*. This question is using the interviewer's preference instead of looking at things objectively. Instead consider the question *"Would you be confident recommending this candidate to any team leader at the company?"*. This evaluates the value a candidate brings to a team instead of our personal preference.

</div>

#### Understanding Common Interview Biases

To maintain fair and objective evaluations, be aware of these common unconscious biases:

**Affinity Bias**
* Favoring candidates who share similar backgrounds, interests, or experiences
* Example: Rating a candidate higher because they attended the same school as you
* Mitigation: Focus on job-relevant criteria, not personal similarities

**Halo Effect**
* Allowing one positive trait to overshadow everything else
* Example: A candidate mentions working at a prestigious company, and you rate all their answers more favorably
* Mitigation: Evaluate each competency independently

**Horn Effect**
* Allowing one negative trait to overshadow everything else
* Example: A candidate has a typo on their resume, so you view all their responses more critically
* Mitigation: Separate minor issues from substantive evaluation criteria

**Contrast Effect**
* Rating a candidate based on comparison to the previous candidate rather than objective criteria
* Example: A mediocre candidate seems great after interviewing a weak candidate
* Mitigation: Use the scoring rubric consistently, not relative comparisons

**Regular calibration sessions with other interviewers are essential to identify and correct for these biases.**

#### Company Core Values

Another important measure of what we are looking for is if the candidate embodies the company's core values. These values are:

* Innovation
* Teamwork (Collaboration/Trustworthiness)
* Customer Focus (Above and Beyond)

#### Rating Candidates

You must determine a final score to provide to each candidate. This score is composed of multiple components from the scoring matrix. The matrix categories are as follows:

* **Skills (10 Points)**: This is a combination of how skilled you think the candidate currently is for the position they are applying to. Factor in the candidates answers from the **skill** and **technical** interview questions.
* **Experience (5 Points)**: This is scored based on prior work experience the candidate possesses. Factor in **personal projects**, and **school projects** as well. It is <u>weighted less</u> as we don't expect co-op's to have a great deal of experience.
* **Company Core Value Alignment (10 Points)**: This is determined by how the candidate answers the **Behavioral** interview questions and meets the "**What are we Looking for**" qualities. These qualities are what makes a candidate a good hire.

To make rating less subjective and consistent across all interviewers, we have created the Candidate Evaluation Form. This form provides an exact breakdown of how the points for each category are to be allocated and scored. This Evaluation system must be used to score all candidates, and then the scores are to be entered into the summary table.

Scores are not set in stone once added to the worksheet. Please review past scores after completing more interviews, as after getting more experience, scores may be higher or lower then originally thought. The candidates we provide offers to will be the top X number of candidates.

✅ The scoring system <u>will not</u> apply perfectly to every candidate. You may find a candidate that you feel is a <u>must hire</u> but with the way the scoring system is designed, they may rate lower. In these cases, highlight the candidate in the scoring sheet and/or notify HR to ensure that this candidate is extended an offer.

Likewise, a candidate may be very skilled and achieve a high score, but interviews poorly and would not be an asset to the company. In these cases, document your specific concerns in the Summary Notes section and raise them during calibration discussions with HR and other interviewers. Do not artificially adjust scores - instead, use the transparent escalation process to ensure all interviewers' concerns are heard and addressed appropriately.

#### Example

An example of the summary table is provided below. The interviewer is responsible for filling out the following columns (any others will be completed by HR or they have a formula).

* Skills (out of 10)
* Experience (out of 5)
* Core Values (out of 10)
* Notable Skills
* Summary Notes
* Team Preference
* Team Recommendation

> **Note:** This table has 18 columns and may require horizontal scrolling. It mirrors the actual Excel sheet used for candidate evaluation.

He showed passion for the industry and knew what the company does. He is a strong communicator and answered behavioural questions well. His coding experience is a bit lacking for a third year. Skill questions were mostly answered correctly. The first coding question he answered perfectly. The second one he needed some guidance but got to the solution. | Cloud | N/A |

#### Extending Offers

Once all interviews are completed, the summary table will be sorted based on total score. At this point, offers will be extended by HR to the top X scoring candidates based on the business need. Additional interview rounds will be conducted if we have not hired enough co-ops based on offers being rejected. As an ambassador, your hiring duties are completed once the ratings have been entered into the summary table.

There is an offer tracking sheet in the Excel file for HR to complete. This will list the current status of all candidates who have been sent an offer. If a second round is required, HR will contact all the ambassadors with additional resumes.
